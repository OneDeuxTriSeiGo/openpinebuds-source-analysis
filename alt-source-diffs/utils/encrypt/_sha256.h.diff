<  *
<  * @brief  This module calculates SHA-256 (SHA-2, FIPS-180) hashes.
<  *
<  * @details To use this module, first call @ref sha256_init on a @ref sha256_context_t instance. Then call @ref
<  *          sha256_update with the data to be hashed. This step can optionally be done with multiple
<  *          calls to @ref sha256_update, each with a section of the data (in the correct order).
<  *          After all data has been passed to @ref sha256_update, call @ref sha256_final to finalize
<  *          and extract the hash value.
